Supplier->Hosting Service:Manually uploads images and model\nto a hosting service off-chain
Supplier->TokenManager:Transacts with TokenManager to make a request.\nProvides:Bid in eth, image links, model link
TokenManager->Chainlink:Sends Request object to oracle
Chainlink->Pipeline:Sends API request to Pipeline with a callback

Pipeline->PipelineRequest:Creates a PipelineRequest
PipelineRequest->Pipeline:Gets added to \nRequest PriorityQueue
Pipeline->Pipeline:Goes through Requests until\n this one is selected
Pipeline->PipelineRequest:Selects Request to \nbe current active request
PipelineRequest->BatchMaker:Seperates the request into Batches\n(for now just one)
Client->BatchMaker:Asks for request through pipeline API\n(gives their eth wallet address too)
BatchMaker->Client:Sends batch info in API return\n(the model and images links)
Client->Hosting Service:Requests images and model
Hosting Service->Client:Sends images and model
Client->Client:Classifies images using model
Client->BatchMaker:Sends image labels through API
BatchMaker->PipelineRequest:Sends image labels
PipelineRequest->Consensus:Sends image labels
Consensus->Consensus:Waits for batch consensus to occur\nAcross many workers
Consensus->PipelineRequest:Sends result of batch
PipelineRequest->Pipeline:Sends completed request info\n(Includes all worker address info)
Pipeline->Chainlink:Uses callback to send completed request
Chainlink->TokenManager:Receives completed Request through callback
TokenManager->Tokens:Mints more tokens, assigns the token owners\nto the workers that participated in completing the request
TokenManager->Supplier:Transacts to send labeled images
TokenManager->Tokens:Transacts to give the eth of the bid in dividends to all minted tokens
